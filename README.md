Message's Below on how to set it up!


- first step - mysql

  *need to setup mysql?* Go Here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/
  
  > You may need to allow localhost to connect if you do not allow remote connections here is a command that should allow you to whitelist yourself 
  > 
  > `$ mysql -u USERNAME -pSECRET_PASSWORD mysql -e "grant ALL on *.* to USERNAME@'localhost' IDENTIFIED by 'SECRET_PASSWORD';"`
   > `$ use my mysql "CREATE DATABASE xdlol;`

  > If you have too many file descriptors open change to however much you need
  > 
  > `$ ulimit -n 999999`
  >
